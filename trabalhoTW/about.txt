        These tools assess various aspects of teaching, such as clarity of
        instruction, engagement techniques, approachability, and the ability to
        create a supportive learning environment. Open-ended questions allow
        students to provide qualitative feedback, highlighting specific
        strengths or areas for improvement. These inquiries provide valuable
        perspectives on how teachers influence learning outcomes and help guide
        professional development efforts.
